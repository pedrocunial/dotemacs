# dotemacs - My .emacs.d directory

This repository was created solely for the sake of storage and version controlling over my Emacs configurations.

I use Emacs Evil Mode, soo if you are into it, give it a try!

### NOTES

* You may need to install the custom fonts (I like to use Inconsolata-g, but there are a couple of other options).

* You may need to install gocode for go autocompletion (https://github.com/nsf/gocode).
